[id="oadp-backup-restore-cr-issues_{context}"]
= Backup and Restore CR issues

The following issues may arise when performing `Backup` and `Restore` on custom resources (CRs).

[id="backup-cannot-retrieve-volume_{context}"]
== Backup CR cannot retrieve volume

The `Backup` CR displays the error message, `InvalidVolume.NotFound: The volume ‘vol-xxxx’ does not exist`.

.Cause

The persistent volume (PV) and the snapshot locations are in different regions.

.Solution

. Edit the value of the `spec.snapshotLocations.velero.config.region` key in the `DataProtectionApplication` manifest so that the snapshot location is in the same region as the PV.
. Create a new `Backup` CR.

[id="backup-cr-remains-in-progress_{context}"]
== Backup CR status remains in progress

The status of a `Backup` CR remains in the `InProgress` phase and does not complete.

.Cause

A backup that is interrupted cannot be resumed.

.Solution

. Retrieve the details of the `Backup` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n {namespace} exec deployment/velero -c velero -- ./velero \
  backup describe <backup>
----

. Delete the `Backup` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete backup <backup> -n openshift-adp
----
+
You do not need to clean up the backup location because a `Backup` CR in progress has not uploaded  files to object storage.

. Create a new `Backup` CR.

[id="backup-cr-remains-partiallyfailed_{context}"]
== Backup CR status remains in PartiallyFailed

The status of a `Backup` CR without Restic in use remains in the `PartiallyFailed` phase and does not complete. A snapshot of the affiliated PVC is not created. 

.Cause

If the backup is created based on the CSI snapshot class, but the label is missing, then the CSI snapshot plugin fails to create a snapshot. The `Velero` pod therefore logs an error similar to the following:
+
[source,text]
----
time="2023-02-17T16:33:13Z" level=error msg="Error backing up item" backup=openshift-adp/user1-backup-check5 error="error executing custom action (groupResource=persistentvolumeclaims, namespace=busy1, name=pvc1-user1): rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to get volumesnapshotclass for storageclass ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd: failed to get volumesnapshotclass for provisioner openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com, ensure that the desired volumesnapshot class has the velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class label" logSource="/remote-source/velero/app/pkg/backup/backup.go:417" name=busybox-79799557b5-vprq
----

.Solution

. Delete the `Backup` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete backup <backup> -n openshift-adp
----

. If required, free up space by cleaning up the stored data on the `BackupStorageLocation`.

. Apply the label `velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class=true` to the `VolumeSnapshotClass` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label volumesnapshotclass/<snapclass_name> velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class=true
----

. Create a new `Backup` CR.

[id="datamover-backup-cleanup_{context}"]
== Datamover backup cleanup

[NOTE]
====
Applies to OADP 1.1.
====

Datamover may leave behind some older snapshots in the bucket, causing the system to recover an older backup. To prevent recovering an outdated backup, delete the folder with old snapshot before creating a new snapshot.

.Remove snapshots in bucket
The snapshots are saved in your bucket specified in the `/<protected-ns> folder`, DPA'.spec.backupLocation.objectStorage.bucketw. Delete this folder to delete *all* snapshots in the bucket.

Additional sub-folder(s) with the prefix z/<volumeSnapshotContent name>-pvc` may be inside the `/<protected-ns>` folder. These folders hold the _volumeSnapshotContent_ backups that datamover created per PVC. Delete each of these sub-folder to delete *a single* snapshot in your bucket.

.Remove cluster resources
The following scenarios can remove the cluster resources:

. Datamover completes

volumeSnapshotBackup/VolumeSnapshotRestore CRs are still in the application namespace.

* Datamover backup:

+
[source, text]
----
oc delete vsb -n <app-ns> --all
oc delete volumesnapshot -A --all
oc delete volumesnapshotcontent --all
oc delete pvc -n <protected-ns> --all
oc delete replicationsource -n <protected-ns> --all
----

* Datamover restore:

+
[source, text]
----
oc delete vsr -n <app-ns> --all
----

. Datamover partiallyFails or Fails:

VSB/VSR CRs exist in the application namespace, as well as extra resources created by these controllers.

* Datamover backup:

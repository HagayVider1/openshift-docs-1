== Known issues

{mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) has the following known issues:

.Not currently possible to migrate associated scc for service account in OCP 4.12

It is not possible to migrate associated security context constraints (SCCs) for service account in {OCP} (OCP) version 4.12. This issue is planned to be resolved in {mtc-short} 1.8.4. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-1454(MIG-1454).

.Vulnerability exposes confidential data stored in cookies

A flaw was found in Axios 1.5.1 that exposes a confidential session token. This flaw allows a remote hacker to bypass security measures and view sensitive data. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2248979[(*BZ#2248979)]

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45857[CVE-2023-45857].

.Flaw in Golang `protobuf` module causes `unmarshal` function to enter infinite loop

A flaw was found in Golang's `protobuf` module, where the `unmarshal` function can enter an infinite loop when processing certain invalid inputs. This issue occurs during the following situations:

* Unmarshaling into a message that includes a `google.protobuf.Any` 
* When the `UnmarshalOptions.DiscardUnknown` option is enabled. 

This flaw allows an attacker to craft malicious input tailored to trigger the identified flaw in the unmarshal function. By providing carefully constructed invalid inputs, they could potentially cause the function to enter an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service condition or other unintended behaviors in the affected system.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-24786[CVE-2024-24786].
